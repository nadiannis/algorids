# Array

Array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. In most programming languages, index starts at 0. So, index of array is starting from 0 to (N-1), where N is the size of the array.

## Operations

These are the common ways we might interact with the data structure:

- Read
- Search
- Insert
- Delete

## Time Complexity

|  Read  | Search (Linear Search) | Insert | Delete |
| :----: | :--------------------: | :----: | :----: |
| $O(1)$ |         $O(N)$         | $O(N)$ | $O(N)$ |
